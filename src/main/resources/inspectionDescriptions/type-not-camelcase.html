<p>A general ROS-wide standard for messages and services is the naming convention for messages and services.<br/>
    The rule is: <i>all messages and services should be written in <b>Capitalised CamelCase</b></i>.<br/>
    Following are the guidelines for CamelCase:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>The only characters allowed are the alphabet (a-z,A-Z) and the digits (0-9). This means <b>no underscores allowed!</b></li>
    <li>Each word starts with a Capital letter, even after a number.</li>
</ol>
<p>This inspection checks whether or not these conditions are met, although proper spelling is left out.
