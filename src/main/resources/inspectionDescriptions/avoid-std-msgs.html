<p>Checks for use of the custom Messages that emulate the builtin types
    (for example, <b>UInt32</b> emulates <b>uint32</b>)</p>
<p>
    When defining custom messages, the builtin types should be used instead of the "standard types":
    they take up less space, and the data they hold is easier to access.
