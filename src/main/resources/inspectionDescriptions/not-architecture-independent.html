<p>If a package is annotated as architecture independent, this inspection makes sure that the compilation of the package
    does not depend on the architecture of the system, like on the CPU/GPU used, etc.
    python packages are considered architecture independent, while C/C++ packages depend on the architecture.
    Please note that this inspection is not exhaustive and cannot account for every language.
