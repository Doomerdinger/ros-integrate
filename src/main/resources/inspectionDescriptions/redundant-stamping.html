    Checks for use of stamped types within a message definition
    (for example, PointStamped is a stamped variant of Point)
</p>
<p>
    Usually, the stamped types should be avoided within custom messages.
    The only stamping in a message should only be at the top level of the message definition (you define it).
</p>
<p>
    However, there are many exceptions to this rule, like nav_msgs/Path which may need to track an object relative to time.

<p>
    This inspection has many options that may be toggled in the inspection profile.
