<p>Checks whether or not the metapackage uses valid dependencies.
    According to <a href="https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0140.html#metapackage">the ROS standards</a>,
    metapackages only provide execution-time dependencies, cannot be used for catkin builds and compile nothing themselves.
    The only thing they are allowed to depend on is ONE buildtool dependency which is used to mark the package as a metapackage.
